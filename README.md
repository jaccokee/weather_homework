Problem Statement
======
 
In the attached weather.dat file youâ€™ll find daily Weather Underground (wunderground.com) data for Austin, TX for January 2017.  Using this text file as an example, write a program to output the following:
 
*   The day number with the smallest temperature spread of the month.  The day number is the 1st field of daily temperature readings.  The highest daily temperature is the 2nd field, and the lowest daily temperature is the 4th field.
*   The total precipitation for the month.  The daily precipitation is the 20th field of the daily temperature readings.

Solution
------
